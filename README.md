## Introduction

Backup And Restore Ceph for Proxmox VE with retention. This solution implements
a snapshotbackup for Ceph cluster exporting to specific directory. The mechanism using
Ceph snapshot, export and export differential. In backup export image and config
file VM/CT.

For _continuous data protection_ see
[eve4pve-autosnap](https://github.com/EnterpriseVE/eve4pve-autosnap)

## Main features

* For KVM and LXC
* Can keep multiple backup
* Can obey a renew policy: (eg. 1 full exports, then 6 incremental exports)
* Supports checksumming
* Syslog integration
* Multiple schedule VM/CT using --label (es. daily,monthly)
* Hook script
* Multiple VM/CT single execution
* Copy config and firewall files
* Export any VM/CT in cluster 'all'
* Export any VM/CT in specific host 'all-hostname'
* Export any VM/CT in specific pool
* Show size of backup and incremental
* Check 'No backup' flag in disk configuration
* Protected/unprotected snap mode
* Notification via email
* Assemble image from diff require
  [eve4ceph-mdti](https://github.com/EnterpriseVE/eve4ceph-mdti)

## Protected / unprotected snapshot

During backup snapshot is created in protected mode, to avoid accidental
deletion. In Proxom VE remove VM not possible with error "Removing all
snapshots: 0% complete...failed". The problem is **Proxmox VE unprotect only the
snapshos it knows**.

Whit parameter **--unprotect-snap** is possible to disable snapshot protection.

## Installation of prerequisites

If you want to use pigz compression which is recommended, install the package:

```apt install pigz curl```

## Configuration and use

There are two ways to use this tool: as APT package or from the Git repository. The Releases are always a little bit behind.

#### APT

Download package eve4pve-barc\_?.?.?-?\_all.deb, on your Proxmox VE host and
install:

```sh
wget https://github.com/EnterpriseVE/eve4pve-barc/releases/download/?.?.?/eve4pve-barc_?.?.?_all.deb
dpkg -i eve4pve-barc_?.?.?-?_all.deb
```

#### From Git:

Map the network share you want the backups to be written to via nfs or cifs. I would recommend to place the backuptool on that share so you have it available if one node fails, otherwise you would have to install it to every node.

```sh
apt -y install git
```

Find out where your share is mounted, and change to that directory (this is usually in /mnt/pve):

```sh
cd /mnt/pve/backup
```

Create a directory where the backups shall live:

```sh
mkdir barc && cd barc
```

Clone the Git repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Corsinvest/cv4pve-barc
```

Pick a release
```sh
git checkout 0.2.5-renew
```

So you want to change to that directory or use the script with it's full path, eg

```sh
/mnt/pve/backup/barc/cv4pve-barc/eve4pve-barc --help
```

## Things to check

- From Proxmox VE Hosts you want to backup you need to be able to ssh passwordless to all other Cluster hosts, that may hold VM's or Containers. This is required for using the free/unfreeze function which has to be called locally from that Host the guest is currently running on. Usually this works out of the box, but you may want to make sure that you can "ssh root@pvehost1...n" from every host to every other host in the cluster.

## Retention mode

eve4barc currently supports two retention modes: --keep and --renew.

- In --keep mode one initial full Backup is made and subsequent incremeltal Backups are collected. Once the keep Value is exceeded, the oldest incremental file is merged with the second oldest. For Example with --keep=4 this would look like:


```ditaa {cmd=true args=["-E"]}
+---------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
|Basecopy |     | diff0    |     | diff1    |     | diff2    |     | diff3    |
|         |---->|          |---->|          |---->|          |---->|          |
+---------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
                             Merge      |
                        +---------------+
                        |
                        V
+---------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
|Basecopy |     | diff0+1  |     | diff2    |     | diff3    |     | diff4    |
|         |---->|          |---->|          |---->|          |---->|          |
+---------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
                             Merge      |
                        +---------------+
                        |
                        V
+---------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
|Basecopy |     | diff0+1+2|     | diff3    |     | diff4    |     | diff5    |
|         |---->|          |---->|          |---->|          |---->|          |
+---------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
```

This goes forever, the Basecopy is never refreshed and the first diff will grow over time.

- In --renew mode, one full Backup is made in regular Intervals, no merging happens. For Example with --renew=3 this would look like:

```ditaa {cmd=true args=["-E"]}
+---------+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+   +---------+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+
|Basecopy0|   |diff0|   |diff1|   |diff2|   |Basecopy1|   |diff0|   |diff1|   |diff2|
|         |-->|     |-->|     |-->|     |-->|         |-->|     |-->|     |-->|     |
+---------+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+   +---------+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+

```

## Some words about Snapshot consistency and what qemu-guest-agent can do for you

Bear in mind, that when taking a snapshot of a running VM, it's basically like if you have a server which gets pulled away from the Power. Often this is not cathastrophic as the next fsck will try to fix Filesystem Issues, but in the worst case this could leave you with a severely damaged Filesystem, or even worse, half written Inodes which were in-flight when the power failed lead to silent data corruption. To overcome these things, we have the qemu-guest-agent to improve the consistency of the Filesystem while taking a snapshot. It won't leave you a clean filesystem, but it sync()'s outstanding writes and halts all i/o until the snapshot is complete. Still, there might me issues on the Application layer. Databases processes might have unwritten data in memory, which is the most common case. Here you have the opportunity to do additional tuning, and use hooks to tell your vital processes things to do prio and post freezes.

First, you want to make sure that your guest has the qemu-guest-agent running and is working properly. Now we use custom hooks to tell your services with volatile data, to flush all unwritten data to disk. On debian based linux systems the hook file can be set in ```/etc/default/qemu-guest-agent``` and could simply contain this line:

```
DAEMON_ARGS="-F/etc/qemu/fsfreeze-hook"
```

Create ```/etc/qemu/fsfreeze-hook``` and make ist look like:

```
#!/bin/sh

# This script is executed when a guest agent receives fsfreeze-freeze and
# fsfreeze-thaw command, if it is specified in --fsfreeze-hook (-F)
# option of qemu-ga or placed in default path (/etc/qemu/fsfreeze-hook).
# When the agent receives fsfreeze-freeze request, this script is issued with
# "freeze" argument before the filesystem is frozen. And for fsfreeze-thaw
# request, it is issued with "thaw" argument after filesystem is thawed.

LOGFILE=/var/log/qga-fsfreeze-hook.log
FSFREEZE_D=$(dirname -- "$0")/fsfreeze-hook.d

# Check whether file $1 is a backup or rpm-generated file and should be ignored
is_ignored_file() {
    case "$1" in
        *~ | *.bak | *.orig | *.rpmnew | *.rpmorig | *.rpmsave | *.sample | *.dpkg-old | *.dpkg-new | *.dpkg-tmp | *.dpkg-dist |
*.dpkg-bak | *.dpkg-backup | *.dpkg-remove)
            return 0 ;;
    esac
    return 1
}

# Iterate executables in directory "fsfreeze-hook.d" with the specified args
[ ! -d "$FSFREEZE_D" ] && exit 0
for file in "$FSFREEZE_D"/* ; do
    is_ignored_file "$file" && continue
    [ -x "$file" ] || continue
    printf "$(date): execute $file $@\n" >>$LOGFILE
    "$file" "$@" >>$LOGFILE 2>&1
    STATUS=$?
    printf "$(date): $file finished with status=$STATUS\n" >>$LOGFILE
done

exit 0
```

For testing purposes place this into ```/etc/qemu/fsfreeze-hook.d/10-info```:

```
#!/bin/bash
dt=$(date +%s)

case "$1" in
    freeze)
        echo "frozen on $dt" | tee >(cat >/tmp/fsfreeze)
    ;;
    thaw)
        echo "thawed on $dt" | tee >(cat >>/tmp/fsfreeze)
    ;;
esac

```

Now you can place files for different Services in ```/etc/qemu/fsfreeze-hook.d/``` that tell those services what to to prior and post snapshots. A very common example is mysql. Create a file ```/etc/qemu/fsfreeze-hook.d/20-mysql``` containing

```
#!/bin/sh

# Flush MySQL tables to the disk before the filesystem is frozen.
# At the same time, this keeps a read lock in order to avoid write accesses
# from the other clients until the filesystem is thawed.

MYSQL="/usr/bin/mysql"
#MYSQL_OPTS="-uroot" #"-prootpassword"
MYSQL_OPTS="--defaults-extra-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf"
FIFO=/var/run/mysql-flush.fifo

# Check mysql is installed and the server running
[ -x "$MYSQL" ] && "$MYSQL" $MYSQL_OPTS < /dev/null || exit 0

flush_and_wait() {
    printf "FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK \\G\n"
    trap 'printf "$(date): $0 is killed\n">&2' HUP INT QUIT ALRM TERM
    read < $FIFO
    printf "UNLOCK TABLES \\G\n"
    rm -f $FIFO
}

case "$1" in
    freeze)
        mkfifo $FIFO || exit 1
        flush_and_wait | "$MYSQL" $MYSQL_OPTS &
        # wait until every block is flushed
        while [ "$(echo 'SHOW STATUS LIKE "Key_blocks_not_flushed"' |\
                 "$MYSQL" $MYSQL_OPTS | tail -1 | cut -f 2)" -gt 0 ]; do
            sleep 1
        done
        # for InnoDB, wait until every log is flushed
        INNODB_STATUS=$(mktemp /tmp/mysql-flush.XXXXXX)
        [ $? -ne 0 ] && exit 2
        trap "rm -f $INNODB_STATUS; exit 1" HUP INT QUIT ALRM TERM
        while :; do
            printf "SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS \\G" |\
                "$MYSQL" $MYSQL_OPTS > $INNODB_STATUS
            LOG_CURRENT=$(grep 'Log sequence number' $INNODB_STATUS |\
                          tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f4)
            LOG_FLUSHED=$(grep 'Log flushed up to' $INNODB_STATUS |\
                          tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f5)
            [ "$LOG_CURRENT" = "$LOG_FLUSHED" ] && break
            sleep 1
        done
        rm -f $INNODB_STATUS
        ;;

    thaw)
        [ ! -p $FIFO ] && exit 1
        echo > $FIFO
        ;;

    *)
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

```


## Backup a VM/CT one time

```sh
root@pve1:~# eve4pve-barc backup --vmid=111 --label='daily' --path=/mnt/bckceph --renew=7d --retain=30d
```

This command backup VM/CT 111. The --renew tells that it you want to have a new Full Backup each 7 days and the --retain tell that you want to retain Snapshots for 30 Days.

## Create a recurring backup job

```sh
root@pve1:~# eve4pve-barc create --vmid=111 --label='daily' --path=/mnt/bckceph --renew=7d --retain=30d
```

## Delete a recurring backup job

```sh
root@pve1:~# eve4pve-barc destroy --vmid=111 --label='daily' --path=/mnt/bckceph --renew=7d --retain=30d
```

## Pause a backup job

```sh
root@pve1:~# eve4pve-barc disable --vmid=111 --label='daily'
```

## Reactivate a backup job

```sh
root@pve1:~# eve4pve-barc enable --vmid=111 --label='daily'
```

## Status

Show status backup in directory destination.

```sh

root@pve1:~# /eve4pve-barc status --vmid=102 --label=daily --path=/mnt/bckceph

*.img/diff files contain your data
.sha1 (or md5 or whatever you choose) file contains the checksum of the _uncompressed_ data
.size file the Size of the uncompressed stream
.conf files contain the VM Configuration.

#####Be advised: Don't tinker with filenames. All the backupchain logic relies on that.

## Last remarks

_Test your Backups on a regular Base. Restore them and see if you can mount and/or boot. Snapshots are not meant to be a full replacement for traditional Backups, don't rely on them as the only Source even if it looks very convenient. Follow the n+1 principle and do filebased backups from within your VM's (with Bacula, Borg, rsync, you name it.). If one concept fails for some reason you always have another way to get your Data._
